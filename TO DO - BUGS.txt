TO DO:
	
	- sequential bloc in control unit

	- is fetching the instruction done correctly?
		Afraid that the PC doesn't change at the right time to get the other part of the instruction

	- is move mem done correctly/
		Afraid that the mem doesn't have the time to send the information or receive it: RTM and MTR
