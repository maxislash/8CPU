Here is the log of the design of an 8-bit CPU I want to design using VHDL and Vivado.

My last VHDL project was a branch predictor less than a year ago. I want to do this on my own to brush up my digital design skills.

I had the idea of this project from my friend who did the same using Verilog (maybe my next project who knows) https://sergeev.io/projects/v8cpu/

First question: Von Neumann or Harvard?
Von Neumann is easier and I am not looking for the most efficient. I know Von Neumann can create a bottleneck at the RAM but I don't really care for this project.

There will be 16 8-bit registers, so 4 bits are needed for the register addresses.
The processor is register-register, so two registers can be addressed in an instruction.

For now, the opcode will be on 8-bits.

The memory address is coded on 16 bits, so the size is 2^16 = 256 bits - 32 octets.

The two last registers are used to address the memory. So if the program wants to store the result in the memory or take the data from the memory, the two 

Now, let's start the instruction set:

	Arithmetic:
	addition		0000 0000 AAAA BBBB | add RA, RB | RA <= RA + RB
	substraction	0000 0001 AAAA BBBB | sub RA, RB | RA <= RA - RB
	and 			0000 0010 AAAA BBBB | and RA, RB | RA <= RA & RB
	or				0000 0011 AAAA BBBB | or RA, RB  | RA <= RA | RB
	xor				0000 0100 AAAA BBBB | xor RA, RB | RA <= RA ^ RB
	not				0000 0101 AAAA xxxx | not RA     | RA <= ~RA
	cmp 			0000 0110 AAAA BBBB | cmp RA, RB | newFlags[EQ_BIT] = (RA == RB);
													   newFlags[GRT_BIT] = (RA > RB);

	Move:
	reg to reg 		0001 0000 AAAA BBBB | mov RA, RB 	| RA <= RB
	mem to reg 		0001 0001 AAAA xxxx | mov MEM, RA 	| RA <= Mem[R14:R15]
	reg to mem      0001 0010 AAAA xxxx | mov RA, MEM 	| Mem[R14:R15] <= RA
	immediate		0010 AAAA DDDD DDDD | mov RA, D 	| RA <= D

	Branch:
	jump 			0100 0000 KKKK KKKK | jmp k 		| PC <= PC + K (K is two's complemented)
